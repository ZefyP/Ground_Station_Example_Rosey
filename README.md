# Ground_Station_Example_Rosey

This example is a sample ground station developed implemented in Python for a school visit demonstration. 

In this example a transceiver sends analog values from a potentiometer, and the data is plotted in the ground station.
The ground station script reads off of the COM port, decodes and processes telemetry received via Heltec radios. The data received is graphed in real time.  

The code is released under the MIT license and is free for anyone to use and modify.
